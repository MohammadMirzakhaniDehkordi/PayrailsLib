Payrails represents a next-generation platform for payment orchestration and revenue management, specifically engineered for businesses navigating the complexities of international payment landscapes. Its foundational objective is to streamline the fragmented, costly, and technically challenging aspects associated with scaling global payment operations. The development of a dedicated Android SDK for Payrails is envisioned as a native interface, designed to empower Android applications with seamless and secure integration capabilities. This SDK's core function will be to facilitate payment acceptance, leverage Payrails' advanced smart routing and tokenization features, and offer a highly customizable checkout experience to end-users, all while substantially alleviating the merchant's burden related to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance.
